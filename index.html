                    In July alone, the alarm bells
                     of the Federal Office for Food Safety rang 11 times. 
                     This was because food or other goods posed a risk to consumers. The range of products 
                     affected is broad: from unauthorised dyes in paprika powder to dangerous LED lights to pesticides in ice cream. 
                     The authority publishes such defective products on its website Recall Swiss. 
                     Goods recalled by traders or products that trigger a public warning are listed there.

                    </p> 
                    Since the beginning of 2020, 324 products have been put on the authorities' red list. 
                    But who sold these defective articles?
                </p>

                     </p> 
                     An analysis of the data shows: The retailer Migros was affected by recalls with striking frequency.
                      The retailer had to recall 37 potentially health-threatening products in the period in question:
                     Among other reasons, because of metals in muesli bars, too high lead content in lentil soups and listeria in salads.

                <p> <h3>Migros and Aldi stand out negatively</h3>
                    
                    The Swiss market leader among the supermarket chains is thus
                     affected above average by recalls. Its main competitor Coop had 
                     to recall only 9 products in the same period. This is despite the fact 
                     that the two retailers generate a similar amount of turnover. Migros' supermarkets had a turnover
                      of 12.7 billion CHF last year. Coop came to 12.1 billion.
                    


                </p>
                The German discounter Aldi also sold many defective products compared to its size.
                 According to market estimates, Aldi Suisse has a turnover of about CHF 2.3 billion. 
                 That is five times less than Coop. Nevertheless, the number of recalls was higher.
                  The discounters Denner and Lidl performed better.
                </p>

                The figures from the Swiss authorities also show that many organic foods have defects. The share of organic food
                 listed on the Recall Swiss website is 20 percent. 
                In contrast, the organic share of Swiss food is only 11 percent.

                    <h3>Organic products are more expensive but less safe</h3>
                    <p>
                   
                </div>
                <p>
                    An earlier analysis of data from European health authorities
                     on recalls of foods with serious dangers showed a different picture. 
                     Organic articles were affected below average in these warnings. 
                     However, these figures also show products that were intended for distribution in Switzerland but never went on sale.
                     The products on Recall Swiss, on the other hand, were sold on the shelves of supermarkets and retailers.


                    </p>According to the figures of the Swiss authorities, the risk of buying defective goods is almost twice as high
                     for organic goods. This is despite the fact that consumers usually have to pay considerably
                      more for organic products than for conventional ones. The price premium does not bring more safety - on the contrary.
