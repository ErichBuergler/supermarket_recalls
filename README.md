# supermarket_recalls
This analysis contains a notebook analyzing the website: https://www.recallswiss.admin.ch/customer-access/. The Federal Office for Food Safety publishes defective products on this website. Goods (food and non-food) recalled by traders or products that trigger a public warning are listed there. 


This repository analyzes all the 324 listed products on the website between January 2020 and 22th July 2022. The notebook looks at which retailers sold how many of those products. It also analyses the share of organic products. Therefore all the headlines of the issued warnings were extracted from the website using an API.	


### Technical Notes:

All of the analyses above are coded in Python 3.
